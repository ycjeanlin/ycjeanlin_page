                    <p>I'm currently a master student in <a href="http://web.ncku.edu.tw/bin/home.php?Lang=en" target="_blank">National Cheng Kung University</a>. My major is Computer Science and Information Engineering. As a programmer, I have worked many kinds of projects related to web and data analytics. Interested by the knowledge hidden in data, I join <a href="http://bigdatalab.cs.nctu.edu.tw/newwebpa/index.php" target="_blank">Big Data Analytics Lab</a> where we mainly focus on the research about data mining and machine learning.</p>

I am fascinated by how to find the valuable knowledge from the abundance of data and further improve people’s life.  Today, the information around us is too much to consume. Motivated by the information explosion, I recently focus on how to filter the information around us and help us to make better choices.  I have been studying about real-time recommender system to solve the filtering problem for few months.</p>
